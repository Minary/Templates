# Templates 
Template files contain the Minary and Plugin configuration for a particular attack setup. The templates are divided into different types. Currently these types are:
  * ***Applicatons***: Attack setup for an application that is installed locally on the target system.
  * ***Mobile apps***: Attack setup for an app that is installed on a mobile target device.
  * ***Websites***: Attack setup that involves a web application running on a remote HTTP server.
